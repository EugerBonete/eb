        Hello, I'm <strong>Euger Bonete</strong>, a web developer with years of
        professional experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my career, I've had the opportunity to work with several
        companies that follow agile methodologies in their development
        processes. This experience has provided me with valuable insights into
        collaborative and adaptive software development practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to <strong>contact me</strong> as I'm actively looking for job
        opportunities.
